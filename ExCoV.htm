    </strong><span class="style7">We propose a variance-component probabilistic model for sparse signal reconstruction and model selection. The
    measurements follow an underdetermined linear model, where the unknown regression vector (signal) is sparse or 
    approximately sparse and noise covariance matrix is known up to a constant. The signal is composed of two disjoint
    parts: a part with significant signal elements and the complementary part with insignificant signal elements that have
    zero or small values. We assign distinct variance components to the candidates for the significant signal elements
    and a single variance component to the rest of the signal; consequently, the dimension of our model&rsquo;s parameter
    space is proportional to the assumed sparsity level of the signal. We derive a generalized maximum likelihood
    (GML) rule for selecting the most efficient parameter assignment and signal representation that strikes a balance
    between the accuracy of data fit and compactness of the parameterization. We prove that, under mild conditions, the
    GML-optimal index set of the distinct variance components <em>coincides</em> with the support set of the sparsest solution to
    the underlying underdetermined linear system. Finally, we propose an expansion-compression variance-component
    based method (ExCoV) that aims at maximizing the GML objective function and provides an approximate GML estimate of the significant signal element set and an empirical Bayesian signal estimate. The ExCoV method is
    <em>automatic</em> and demands no prior knowledge about signal-sparsity or measurement-noise levels. We also develop
    a computationally and memory efficient approximate ExCoV scheme suitable for large-scale problems, apply the
    proposed methods to reconstruct one- and two-dimensional signals from compressive samples, and demonstrate
    their reconstruction performance via numerical simulations. Compared with the competing approaches, our schemes
    perform particularly well in challenging scenarios where the noise is large or the number of measurements is small. </span> </p>

 ExCoV: <br><br>
  </strong> ExCoV

 is <em>automatic </em>and does not need any convergence tolerance level or threshold. Therefore, using 


 ExCoV

 is easy: just input&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;the measurement column vector and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;the sensing matrix (number of measurements by the
length of signal) <br>
  and 


 ExCoV

 will do the rest. For more details on using 


 ExCoV

 and running the demo, please refer to the readme file in the package. </p>
  <p align="justify" class="style4">Compared with competing approaches,

  <p align="justify" class="style4"><strong>Illustrative Examples:
  <br><br> 
  </strong> The following videos show the reconstruction
  progress of our 


 ExCoV

 algorithm. The sparse signal of length 512
  contains 20 randomly placed binary spikes, taking values -1 or +1
  with equal probability.&nbsp;We took 100 noisy measurements using a
  Gaussian sensing matrix with orthonormalized rows and zero-mean
  white Gaussian noise with variance <small>10<sup>-3</sup></small>. The
	videos in the left and right panels correspond
  to typical and atypical reconstructions, respectively, performed by
  the 


 ExCoV

 algorithm under the chosen simulation setup. The
  atypical reconstruction corresponds to a difficult case. Following
  the videos, we show Fig. 1 with the signal estimates of various
  methods for the difficult case. </p> 
  <p align="justify" class="style4">Figs. 2 and 3 show the average MSEs of various methods ) as functions of the number of measurements <em>N</em>, for binary sparse signals (Fig. 2) and Gaussian sparse signals (Fig. 3). The simulated sparse signals have length 512 containing 20 randomly placed non-zero elements. The sensing matrix is Gaussian with orthonormalized rows and the measurement noise is white Gaussian with mean zero and variance <small>10<sup>-5</sup></small>. To reproduce Figs. 2 and 3, please download version 2.0 of the code and run the simulation according to the readme file.</p>
  <p align="justify" class="style4">We demonstrate the reconstruction of the Shepp-Logan phantom of 
  size 128 by 128 in Fig. 4 (a) from tomographic 
projections. The elements of the measurements are 2-D discrete Fourier transform 
(DFT) coefficients of the phantom image in Fig. 4 (a) sampled over a star-shaped domain, as illustrated 
in Fig.4 (b). We use Haar wavelet as the sparsifying basis and the effective sensing matrix for the sparse wavelet coefficients is a composition of selected 
rows of 2-D DFT matrix specified by the star shape in Fig.4 (b) and the inverse Haar wavelet matrix. Fig.4 (c)-(f) present the reconstructed images from the 30 radial lines given in  Fig.4 (b) by filtered back-projection, normalized IHT, GPSR and approximate 


 ExCoV,

 respectively. In Fig. 5, we vary the number of radial lines from 26
to 43, and, consequently, the measurement ratio N/m from 0.19 to 0.31. The codes for this tomographic imaging example have been included in the Version 2.1 package.</p>
